            <p>Work in progress! I am native Baltimorean and a good-hearted man, striving to be the exception in today's ever-changing world. Counting my blessings for the things that some take for granted. Using my blessings to make someone else's day brighter. We tend to forget, it's those little things that mean so much. I live to absorb life's lessons, grow, and influence where God sees fit.
             I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice/Homeland Security from Strayer University in 2014, and earned my Master of Science from The University of Maryland Global Campus in 2016, in Cyber Security. 
             I have 20 years of dedicated service to the U.S. Courts for the District of Maryland, assuming various positions as a Paraprofessional. 
             I love to spend time with my family and friends, doing anything exciting to promote unity! I like playing games (UNO, Trivia); the great outdoors on warm days; reading and listening to music. I love traveling to new destinations, which have primarily been in the US. But I am planning to take a 7 cruise soon to anywhere that allows me to bask in the sun, frolic in the clear blue water, and meet incredible new people!  
             I attribute my zest for new experiences to what is now my mantra from on of my favorite individuals:
             
            <b><i>"Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.</i></b> 
            <b>Maya Angelou</b>
